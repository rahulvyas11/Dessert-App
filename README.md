# Dessert Recipes App
## Installation
Open the xcodeproj file and build the project. Fetch_Take_HomeApp is the main function.

## Overview
This is my submission for the apprenticeship. Take Home Exercise. Below are details on how I implemented the application.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rahulvyas11/Dessert-App.git
```

### 2. Open the Project in Xcode
Open the .xcodeproj file or the .xcworkspace file (if you are using CocoaPods or another dependency manager):

### 3. Build and Run the Project
In Xcode:

Select your target device or simulator from the top device menu.
Press Cmd + R or click the "Run" button to build and run the project.


## Setup
1. I have used MVVM. There is a Networking Layer that handles all Nework Requests.
2. I have a package called Desserts that handles displaying Desserts on the Home Page with their name and thumbnail. When the User clicks on the dessert they are taken to a more detailed page with the recipe.
3. I have a package called RecipeDetails that handles the displaying of Recipe Details.
4. I have added necessary Unit tests in the Fetch Take HomeTests module.
